- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DanieleCarraro
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning back-end and front-end technologies!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at Epicode - Java - SpringBoot using PostgreSQL
- ğŸŒ± I'm also interested in front-end technologies, like JS, CSS/SASS to begin, next will be angular/react and so on!
- ğŸ˜º I think that to code is a way to express ourselves!
